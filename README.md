# Chingu Voyage Pre-work Project (Tier 1): Website Template

## Overview
This project provides you with Great Practice Making MODERN LOOKING web apps by cloning the "Conquer" Website Template
in HTML/CSS/JS WITHOUT the Bootstrap and Jquery!

When you download it to check out, the design is made using Bootstrap and Jquery, but we want you to make it without
those libraries, just using your mad HTML, CSS, and JavaScript skillz!

When you are done, this type of template looks terrific and gracefully responds on all devices. You could make different 
versions to use in future web apps you develop!
